What is a developer?

According to a developers best friend, google, a software developer is a person concerned with facets of the software development process, including the research, design, programming, and testing of computer software. But to me it encompasses so much more than that. 

As a mechanical engineer I have been exposed to the method and processes of designing, testing and bringing to life new and innovative tools and mechanism that help society carry day to day activities that lead to evolution and progress. After some time in the industry I realized, the process of making something come to life is incomplete, now a days, without the device being self-sufficient or have the ability to interpret and interact with human input seamlessly. 

Developing software involves understanding the way the user or target audience you are designing for thinks. This understanding can lead to creating a maintainable and exponentially expandable product that can impact and help millions. Being able to play a role in consistently finding new ways of using this technology sparked the fire that lead me to this journey.

Tools and devices that I have been a part of creating as an ME had was a very standard process and metrics for validating and testing the viability of the product. But every project you develop is unique and requires thinking of new ways to test, validate and implement pre-existing components and cooperating with brilliant minds around the world. The use of open source is like having the brush of Picasso right at my fingertips.

Simple, open source and easy to access technologies create an unlimited gamma of possibilities. But the best part is that weather it be self taught or through an amazing curriculum, such as Flatiron, you have an empty canvas with all the colors and techniques in the world. This puzzle doesn't fit in any specific way, but can make the most beautiful masterpiece when used to its maximum potential.
