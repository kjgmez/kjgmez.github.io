Building a porfolio is the best way to showcase your problem solving skills, preparation for creating a new app or service and overall adaptability as a Software Developer/Engineer. In a bootcamp, you are pushed to create apps that help showcase how you can apply the tools at your disposal. There are many ways to apporoach these projects. My approach to these "portfolio projects", though not the best for time management and simplicity, is what I like to call the dreamer student approach. 

My mind likes to wonder and think of grand, all be it ambitious for the time being, ways I would love to apply what I've learned and create the next experience enhacing app. This may lead to many of the subjects of the apps I build trending around the passions I enjoy, since I have first hand experiences with user issues as well as a gamma of people to bounce ideas off of. I present to you the dreamer/engineer.

First I sit with the requirements and try to outline what is reuired from the course, obviously I want to pass and get the cert. I follow by adding features and different component I want to showcase from the app. Two hours later I have 10 crumpled papers of diagrams held together by sticky notes, a lead telling me that I dont have to reinvent the wheel and a deadline that only gets closer. 

Here in lies the best part of this misleading initial plan, it will serve as the hardest critic and lesson along the way for a growing developer. The ambitious idea will push you to go past course content and use the good old google, git and stackoverflow to look for past heaches of other people with the same issue. These new approaches, to the rookie, will create defenite hurdles and push for understanding new material and go down rabbit wholes that will prove useful on their future career. 

I have heard that some of the code implemented in my projects is different or "impressive", but I cannot take credit. It is thanks to others who have struggled and overcome before me that I can look at different approaches and come up with my own process to solve whatever issue is causing me to bang my head. The projects I aim to complete during this bootcamp are like puzzles and baseline setters, where the goal is not to pass, but to be exposed to what the real world will throw at me. "Dream bing and fail forward" says Denzel Washington, since we learn more from our falures than our victories. I defenitely fail... allot, but the experience and lessos are invaluable.
